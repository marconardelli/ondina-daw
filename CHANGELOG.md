# Changelog

All notable changes to Aurora are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-31

### Fixed

- Arrange window: dragging the right edge of a region resizes it again, as a single undo step.

### Security

- The MCP server now refuses requests with `Origin: null` (sent by sandboxed iframes and pages opened from files)
  unless `AURORA_MCP_TOKEN` is set, so a web page can no longer drive Aurora through the local server.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-31

### Changed

- Piano roll: Quantize, Humanize and Snap to key now work on the selected notes only (all notes when nothing is
  selected), and the same notes stay selected afterwards.
- The matching MCP tools (`quantize_notes`, `humanize_notes`, `snap_notes_to_key`) accept an optional list of note
  indices.
- The AI assistant now knows which notes are selected in the piano roll, so you can ask it to work on just those.

### Fixed

- Undo right after opening a project or starting a new one no longer brings back the previous project.
- A project that has just been opened is no longer marked as modified.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-31

First public release.

- Piano roll box selection: drag on empty space to select every note in the rectangle, including stacked notes.

### Fixed

- Piano roll: clicking an existing note now selects it instead of adding a duplicate note on top of it;
  double-click / right-click delete and resizing from the right edge work again.
- Piano roll: selected notes are clearly highlighted, also during playback.
